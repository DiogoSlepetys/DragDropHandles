# DragDropHandles
Tiny Library for interactive tasks, for connecting labels to SVGs and implementing simple Drag &amp; Drop elements

Mobile Friendly!

The library has two functions:

* makeDraggables()
	It's a simple Drag & Drop Script

* makeConnectables()
	It's a Drag & Drop that works with SVG images as in the screenshot below.
